== Introduction

Ruby bindings for the yara malware analysis library.

YARA is a tool aimed at helping malware researchers to identify and classify 
malware families. With YARA you can create descriptions of malware families
based on textual or binary information contained on samples of those families.
These descriptions, named rules, consist of a set of strings and a Boolean
expression which determines the rule logic.

Yara and it's code are copyrights of Victor M. Alvarez. Please see
http://code.google.com/p/yara-project/


== Usage

  # basic example... find all PE files under the current dir

  require 'yara'

  ctx = Yara::Rules.new
  ctx.compile_string "rule IsPE { condition: uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550 }"

  Dir["**/*", "*"].each do |fname|
    begin
      next unless File.file?(fname)
      ctx.scan_file(fname).each {|match| puts "#{fname} -> #{match.rule}" }
    rescue Yara::ScanError => e
      STDERR.puts e
    end
  end

== Versioning
The current version of libyara at the time of writing is 2.0.0. Bindings
have been written against this API and may not work with earlier versions
of the libyara library.

The major and minor version numbers of the ruby library are intended
to be in step with the C api version.

Note that yara-ruby began existence as of yara 1.4 so binding versions
go back this far. The yara 1.4 binding in ruby to use is the most recent
1.4.X gem, and so on.

== Requirements
* libyara 1.5 must be installed - http://code.google.com/p/yara-project/

== Installation

First make sure you have libyara and its dependencies installed. You'll need
libyara and yara.h in your search paths.

Install the yara ruby package from a gem:

    (sudo)? gem install yara

Or from the github package.

    git clone https://github.com/SpiderLabs/yara-ruby.git
    cd yara-ruby
    rake compile
